# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis  
**Phases 1 & 2: Data Cleaning, Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis**

This project explores the Netflix catalog to uncover trends in content types, ratings, genres, and countries of origin.  
It is part of my personal data science portfolio.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize trends in Netflix content by year, rating, and category  
- Develop data storytelling skills and generate actionable insights  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)  

## 📁 Project Structure
- `netflix_titles.csv`  
- `netflix_cleaned_v2.csv`  
- `Netflix_EDA.ipynb`  
- `/images/`  
- `README.md`  

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/netflix-data/data?select=Netflix+Dataset.csv)

## 🚀 Progress Tracker
- Phase 1: Data cleaning and preprocessing — Completed  
- Phase 2: Exploratory data analysis and visualization — Completed
